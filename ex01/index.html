      <strong>Hi and welcome to Codecamp!</strong> You may or may not have had some experience with programming before. If not then don't panic. We will try and go at a pace that suits everyone. If you have installed Chrome and Atom then you are ready to go. If not then please see our instructions on <a href="../how-to-install-chrome.html">installing Chrome</a> and <a href="../how-to-install-atom-editor.html">installing Atom</a>, go and do that and then come back here.
      <br><br>
      Right - done that? Before we start the course proper, we would like you to have a play with Atom and Chrome.  In this pre-course exercise we are going to write our first program. Oh and by the way, if you hadn't already realised, you should be viewing this page in Chrome! So make sure you are doing this before you move on.
      </p>
      <p class="warning">
        You must ensure at this point that you are viewing this page in Google Chrome. No Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari or Opera!
      </p>
      <p>
      The objective of this preparatory exercise is to get you familiar with the Atom editor and the Chrome browser. To program in HTML all you need is a basic text editor and a browser. Mostly any browser will do, however we will be using Chrome for the duration of the workshop.
      <br><br>
      We will be writing a very basic function - so you should understand that a function is some kind of action usually performed by an object. An example object would be a calculator program. The calculator can add 2 numbers together. It achieves this by passing two numbers to and calling an 'add' function.
      <br><br>
      Let's spend some time getting aquainted with Atom.

      <ol>
        <li>When you first starup Atom, you will get a screen that looks like this.

		<img src="img/startupscreenatom.jpg"></li>
        <li>Open the <strong>Command Palatte</strong> using Ctrl+Shift+P. This is a search-driven menu to look for something. With this, you can quickly search through thousands of commands

		</li>
		<li>To open the <strong>Settings</strong> View, you can:
			Use the File &gt;         Settings menu item in the menu bar or
			Search for settings-view:open in the Command Palette
		<br><br>

		</li>
		<li>You can set the whitespace and wrapping settings in <strong>Soft Wrap</strong>.
		Use the File &gt; Settings &gt; Editor menu item in the menu bar
