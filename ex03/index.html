      <strong>HTML</strong> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It’s a markup code for building the structure of a web page and HTML5 is the latest version.
	  'Hypertext' means machine readable text and 'Markup' means to structure it in a specific format. The markup transforms raw text (HTML tags) into structured HTML documents.
      <br><br>
    A piece of code would look something like this

	<strong>Responsiveness</strong><br>
	When a website design adapts to different devices, like tablets, smart phones, desktop monitors of different sizes to provide an optimal viewing experience, it is called a responsive website. Responsiveness aims at making the website fluid

	<strong>Getting organised</strong>
	<br>Before building our first website, we need to get our files organised.
	Once wampserver is set up and turned on, create a folder named “MyWebsite” in C://wamp/www
	We create two new folders within the “MyWebsite” named “css” and “js”
